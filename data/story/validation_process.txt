the old building in this turkish town had modern satellite dishes . the view of the town reveals denselypacked housing . this must be a very old building that has fallen into disrepair . it 's a shame this building is so run down . the old street would be beautiful with a little repair .
there was a big accident on the corner of the street . the cars were all bent out of shape from the impact . the surrounding neighbors came out of their house to try and help with the situation , but there was little they could do to help the cars . someone then called the cops who then rushed to the scene to offer assistance .

i was in the mood for a hike , so i decided to go to the beach . i hiked along the shoreline around sunset . it was very calming , and i felt rejuvenated . i guess a friend of mine had the same idea , we continued the hike together . we walked until dusk and then parted ways .

eating right is an important issue in many people 's lives . for some eating is not an issue . when tempted by candy , it is difficult to resist because of how it effects our brain . and its especially difficult during holidays . strangely , we find every which way to get sweets into our mouths and around our waistline . some get very creative and try all kinds of varieties to keep it competitive . even bread isnt safe some times when you come across other cultures . the bottom line is : everything in moderation .

i have always lived inland during my younger years and have a yearning for the sea now and i am fascinated by cottage style communities close to the ocean side . i enjoy traveling around looking for where i would like to spend the rest of my days and i love to take pictures of the places i find the most appealing . this house was one that i would have loved to buy if it had been for sale because i thought it was just perfect for me . i found this home beautifully landscaped and just the perfect size for myself and what i have to fill it with but it is not available either . i suppose i will keep on with my search to find that perfect cottage by the sea and to take pictures along my way of what might have been if the timing had been right .

although we were tired of sightseeing , when it looked like a bad storm was approaching we ducked into the nearest church . there , we were stunned by the beauty inside . it was remarkable that human ingenuity and relatively primitive tools had constructed such a building . we realized it was deep religious feelings and the desire to express these feelings that inspired the designers and workers . as we stepped into a courtyard and looked upon the expansive sky , it was easy to see how they had been so inspired .

i saw [female] the poo at a theme park in location . we visited during christmas and the decorations were so colorful . i loved the classic look of some of the attraction , especially the retro mickey mouse . the water show was stunning with lots of colors and people dancing . but the best attraction by far was the castle . it looked like a fictional drawing come to life .

all the stands are pretty much empty as we get ready to set things up for the race . people start to gather as the start of the race draws near . these two go very fast on the track after the start . getting closer to the finish line , these two contenders push on . bikes and motorcycles racing together , the speed is intense .
we visited one of the newly built homes and it had both advantages and faults . the living room was very well decorated with plenty of light coming through the over-sized windows . the nearby family room had a modern fireplace and tv alcove but the symmetry seemed off . and the basement was not completed . finally the neighboring lots are still empty creating a feeling of loneliness .
the old band decided to reunite for a charity event . [male] has n't missed a beat since he play 's in another band full-time . [male] could use a some water since his voice sounds hoarse . [male] was really having a good time with his old guitar . the concert was a success and raised money for a good cause .

the people are getting ready to enter the hall . the first speaker engages the crowd with a funny story . a camera man films the speakers . a couple of the crowd members discuss what the speaker just talked about . the crowd applauds when the speaker finishes .
some people call our vacation spot paradise . there would certainly be an argument for that , especially when you look out at the boats . however , the beach is covered with with extremely odd jellyfish type animals . they are enough to completely freak you out . then you see something like the parrots , and you are thinking paradise again .
the landscape offered an escape not a soul around these parts the fog came in early over the bridge and the animals were roaming the ice it was a very cold day indeed

this mother seal is giving birth . she will push until the baby is delivered . once out the baby will lay there and get its strength up until it can move about . then you can see how the baby starts looking around for mom . in no time flat the baby is up and ready to go .
the late snowfall would probably kill the plants . it was n't very deep enough to kill the pesky weeds that grew close the the gazebo . for some reason the snow was deeper in his backyard . across the water he could see the island had very little snow . in some places you could see the grass and the poor birds scrounged for food .
